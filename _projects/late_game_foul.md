In the high-stakes final moments of NBA games, coaches face a critical decision when leading by 3 points: foul intentionally or trust in their defense? This analysis investigates that strategic dilemma using two decades of NBA data (2003â€“2023) to assess whether fouling actually increases a teamâ€™s chances of winning. Although the intentional foul has gained traction in recent years as a way to prevent game-tying three-pointers, our analysis reveals a surprising finding: teams won at nearly identical rates regardless of the strategy they chose. Using a Bayesian binomial regression model across 5,418 late-game scenarios, we find that <strong>fouling can even become counterproductive â€” especially when opponents have demonstrated strong free-throw shooting earlier in the game</strong>. Rather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all solution, our results underscore the importance of adapting late-game decisions to the specific opponent and context. This work provides coaches and analysts with data-driven insights to support more nuanced end-of-game decision-making in high-stakes situations.
