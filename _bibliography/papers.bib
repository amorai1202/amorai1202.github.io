  title={Implicit vs Explicit Stereotype Threat Activation Effect on Performance Mindsets},
  author={Ai, A.},
  abstract={Positive stereotypes, such as model minority stereotypes, can impact important academic outcomes for Asian American students. Building on prior research on implicit vs explicit forms of stereotype activation, this study examines whether and how much performance mindsets (i.e., motivation to succeed or avoid failure) affects task performance in a stereotyped domain for Asian American students, i.e., math ability. In a 1x3 between-subjects study, stereotype activation (implicit, explicit, none) was manipulated prior to performing a spatial rotation task that participants believed measured their math ability. We found no evidence that the manner of stereotype activation led to differences in task accuracy, nor did scores on an Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ-R) predict task performance or mediate the effects of our manipulation. However, pre- and post-task measures revealed a significantly lower endorsement of performance-approach goals and diminished levels of racial centrality after the manipulation and task, compared to the participants’ baseline. We also examined other factors relevant to stereotype threat in exploratory analyses that highlight avenues for future research in this area.},

  title="{Do the Source and Motivation of DEI Statements Matter?}",
  author={Ai, A. and Nam, K. and Jarbo, K. and Manke-Miller, K.},
  abstract={Existing literature examines DEI interventions and their outcomes, as well as an individuals’ sense of belonging at an institution. However, the link between DEI interventions and how they affect perceived respect from instructors within an institution remains unclear. In a 2 (authorship) x 2 (motivation) between-subjects study, we found that DEI statements thought to be authored by professors or thought to be included through intrinsic motivation led to increased faculty-student respect (FSR). This was qualified by a significant interaction such that internally
motivated statements from professors had the highest FSR. These findings suggest that DEI statements within syllabi should be internally motivated declarations written by the professors themselves to foster a positive learning environment where students feel respected and supported by their professor.},
