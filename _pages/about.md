Hello! I'm a researcher in the [Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/) and Stanfordâ€™s Department of Political Science. My work spans both the research and end-to-end development of the [GeoMatch](https://immigrationlab.org/geomatch/) tool, a machine learning algorithm that matches *people* to *places* where they are most likely to thrive.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of behavioral science, data science, and decision-making. In my free time, I enjoy tackling data-driven questions and building apps that visualize insights in the sports analytics space. 

Previously, I was a part of the [Data-Driven-Diversity Lab](https://www.d3lab.org/) and worked as a data scientist for a professional sports team.
