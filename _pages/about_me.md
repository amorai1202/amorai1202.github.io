I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with degrees in Statistics and Psychology, along with an additional major in Decision Science. My undergraduate research in social psychology examined stereotype threat, diversity messaging, and the design of [psychologically wise interventions](https://www.wiseinterventions.org/what-are-wise-interventions) to improve educational outcomes. During that time, I also conducted research in sports analytics and worked as a data scientist in the R&D department of the Pittsburgh Pirates, where I built statistical models and decision-support tools for player evaluation and development — think [*Moneyball*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball:_The_Art_of_Winning_an_Unfair_Game).

I was raised in the suburbs of Vancouver, BC and have spent much of my later life in the Bay Area and the greater Seattle area. Once a competitive basketball player, I now coach high school hoops and am a big fan of women’s sports. Over the years, I’ve dabbled in everything from climbing to Olympic weightlifting, but these days you’ll most likely find me out on a [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/amor_ai). I’m a sneaker enthusiast with a soft spot for hidden food gems and a good cup of coffee. I currently live in Santa Clara with my foster fail and partner-in-crime, Parker.

I’d love to hear what’s been on your mind lately — whether it’s a recent curiosity or current obsession. Book, food, or podcast recs are always welcome too!
